# Sorting-algorithms

To Comapare the time complexities please uncomment the following 3 lines:

-> long a = System.nanoTime();
-> long b = System.nanoTime();
-> System.out.Println(b-a);

This will calculate the difference between the entry and exit time i.e the execution time.

Please use inputs of length > 15 to see effective differences between the algorithms.
