# Sorting-algorithms

This project is a demonstration of the different sorting algorithms implemented in Java.

Tip 1:
To Comapare the time complexities please uncomment the following 3 lines from the sort method of every program:

1) long a = System.nanoTime();
2) long b = System.nanoTime();
3) System.out.Println(b-a);

This will calculate the difference between the entry and exit time i.e the execution time.

Tip 2:
Please use inputs of length > 15 to see effective differences between the algorithms.
